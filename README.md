I wrote this software to encode video files to AV1 using SVT-AV1.

Written in Visual Basic .NET using Visual Studio 2019.

## Dependencies:

* You need ffmpeg as found here: https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/. Use the nightly builds. [Instructions here.](https://moisescardona.me/downloading-ffmpeg-svt-av1-gui/)

Builds comes mediainfo and SVT-AV1 bundled, but not ffmpeg due to licensing restrictions.

# Updated components builds:

Ocasionally, SVT-AV1 and mediainfo gets updated. You can download the latest version of SVT-AV1 GUI with these updated tools included here: [https://moisescardona.me/svt-av1-gui](https://moisescardona.me/svt-av1-gui)

Enjoy!
